# Impose a coordinate system on the grid with grid points at the center of each square.
# We start on the square centered at (0,0). Each square corresponds to the grid point in its center.
# We are tracing out some shape by following the instructions; instead of cutting out whole squares,
# imagine drawing a line through the corresponding grid points.

# Pick's theorem: Suppose we have a polygon with integer coordinates with area A,
# B integer points along its boundary, and I integer points strictly within.
# Then A = I + (B/2) - 1.

# The solution to the problem is just I+B, the number of grid points / squares in the shape,
# plus the number of squares/points on the inside of the shape.
# Rearranging, Pick's theorem tells us I = A - (B/2) + 1.
# So I+B = A + (B/2) + 1.
# B is just the perimeter - the sum of N across all commands.
# (note: each command actually covers N+1 squares, but the ending square of each command is also covered by the
#  starting square of the next command. So summing N gets the correct number of squares in the path)
# We can compute the area A in two different ways:
# - The shoelace formula: A = (\sum X[i]*Y[i+1] - X[i+1]*Y[i]) // 2
# - Green's theorem: A = \sum y * dx = \sum x * dy
